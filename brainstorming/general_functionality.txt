THOUGHTS:
You make an account and indicate your prefered method of communication. You create "hobby cards" of sorts for the hobbies you're looking to find partners for.
Can search for other users with a number of filters applied.
Map will be on left side of screen showing approximate location (AirBnB style), right side will be listed users.
Top 3 relevant tags will be the details that appear.
You have to click on the user to see their details. 
If you are interested in connecting with a user after seeing their details, you can click some sort of "Reach Out" button. The user will receive a notificaiton on their end, and can indicate whether they wish to reach out or not. If the "yes" button of sorts, it will exchange contact information between the users.


QUESTIONS:
1. When a person clicks on a user for more details, do they get taken to a page/pop-up with the detials for just that hobby listing? Or to their account page will all their "hobby cards"?

CONCERNS:
1. Ethics wise, what's to stop people from getting a persons contact info via matching, but then sharing that all over the place? (this would be the benefit of on-site messaging, but that's a pain)
